 Fixes Needed:


 quizpack mode fastest team no show in app - but works in keypad - Copy prompt below:

 in the application / host app, on keypad mode when the "fastest team" action gets triggered, it shows the graph and team photo and details etc all correctly, but on quiz pack mode its not shoing the graph, stats, team picture area etc, can you copy it from the keypad on the spot mode to display the same stats when the "Fastest Team" action gets triggered as theres information in there that will be valuble to the user of the host app. - ask me questions if you arent sure

 if team wrong, right answer should flash orange not green?
 red flashing not showing either on keypad 

 need arrows for next quesstion and previous question

 add logic if player joins mid question
