   Fixes Needed:


 quizpack mode fastest team no show in app - but works in keypad - Copy prompt below:

 in the application / host app, on keypad mode when the "fastest team" action gets triggered, it shows the graph and team photo and details etc all correctly, but on quiz pack mode its not shoing the graph, stats, team picture area etc, can you copy it from the keypad on the spot mode to display the same stats when the "Fastest Team" action gets triggered as theres information in there that will be valuble to the user of the host app. - ask me questions if you arent sure

 if team wrong, right answer should flash orange not green?
 red flashing not showing either on keypad 

 need arrows for next quesstion and previous question

 add logic if player joins mid question

 points arent always getting added to a team if they answer correctly

 pictures when sent to the phone need to be clickable to disapear rather than show above the options

 sound needs to be mapped in the files for applause and timer countdown

 arrow keys to skip questions and also a show/hide answer at bottom of the screen for host

 enforce demo mode into application to stop hosts from bypassing licence
