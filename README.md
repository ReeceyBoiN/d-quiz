First Time Instructions for player app:
Get your IP from CMD (ipconfig) then on a phone on the same wifi network, enter your IPv4 followed by ":4310" as thats the port.



   Fixes Needed:

 points arent always getting added to a team if they answer correctly

 reveal answer isnt showing on player device

 response time isnt calced in quizpack mode

 Hide question, should progress to view the next buttons of start timer rather than having to click show question to proceed too

 x activation needs to be assigned to a specific laptop / mac address so users cant log in, activate, then turn off wifi and log into another laptop to download same activation

 pictures when sent to the phone need to be clickable to disapear rather than show above the options

 sound needs to be mapped in the files for applause so when any team answers correctly it plays one of the applause clapping noise, it can choose any of those at random in that folder but shouldnt play if 0 teams answer correctly. - We will add a toilet flush noise if all plays

 x enforce demo mode into application to stop hosts from bypassing licence

 Add the filter for questions so "THE LION KING" answer isnt a "T" as we're ignoring the word "THE" So for questions that may get added in the future, if the answer is "The Cat" then it should be the letter C as the correct answer.

 When a Teams Pic is sent from a teams phone, its not getting assigned to the team or coming through to host app.

 Scaling visually needs adding as its currently too cramped on the screen slightly whole software wide. Needs all visual elements reducing by 10% or so.

 If a Team disconnects, The team in the teams list should go grey not just disapear from the teams list
