   Fixes Needed:


 need arrows for next quesstion and previous question

 add logic if player joins mid question

 points arent always getting added to a team if they answer correctly

 activation needs to be assigned to a specific laptop / mac address so users cant log in, activate, then turn off wifi and log into another laptop to download same activation

 pictures when sent to the phone need to be clickable to disapear rather than show above the options

 sound needs to be mapped in the files for applause and timer countdown

 arrow keys to skip questions and also a show/hide answer at bottom of the screen for host

 enforce demo mode into application to stop hosts from bypassing licence

 Add the filter for questions so "THE LION KING" answer isnt a "T" as we're ignoring the word "THE"

 Team Pic sent from phone not getting assigned to a team or coming through to host app

 Points arent being added on a game mode

 Scaling visually needs adding
