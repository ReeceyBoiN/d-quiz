   Fixes Needed:

 points arent always getting added to a team if they answer correctly

 reveal answer isnt showing on player device

 response time isnt calced in quizpack mode

 Hide question, should progress to view the next buttons of start timer rather than having to click show question to proceed too

 x activation needs to be assigned to a specific laptop / mac address so users cant log in, activate, then turn off wifi and log into another laptop to download same activation

 pictures when sent to the phone need to be clickable to disapear rather than show above the options

 sound needs to be mapped in the files for applause

 x enforce demo mode into application to stop hosts from bypassing licence

 Add the filter for questions so "THE LION KING" answer isnt a "T" as we're ignoring the word "THE"

 Team Pic sent from phone not getting assigned to a team or coming through to host app

 Scaling visually needs adding

 Team disconnects - should go grey not disapear from the team but show they have disconeected
